Repository for my personal c++ OpenGL game library.  
Targets for Linux, Windows, and WebGL3

It is designed to be more of a collection of separate modules
rather than a fully intergrated game engine and editor

Features:  
- Window creation  
- Game state manager  
- Scene graph  
- Gui system  
- Controller support  
- png and dds textures  
- Custom extensible model format, and obj loader  
- Blender exporter included for model format  
- Skeletal animation and morphs  
- Node based compositor system  
- Resource manager  
- Particle system  
- Audio system using openAL as a backend  
- Navmesh system  
- Simple scripting language designed for data storage
- Foliage system  
- Heightmap terrain with continuous LOD  
- VR support using OpenXR  
- A collection of extra utilities and classes  

Things mostly get added to it once I realise I have rewritten the same code multiple times,
or utilities I have copied between multiple projects.
