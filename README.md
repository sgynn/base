Repository for my personal c++ OpenGL game library.  
Targets for Linux, Windows, and WebGL3

rather than a fully intergrated game engine and editor

Features:  
- Window creation  
- Game state manager  
- Scene graph  
- Gui system  
- Controller support  
- png and dds textures  
- Custom extensible model format, and obj loader  
- Blender exporter included for model format  
- Skeletal animation  
- Node based compositor system  
- Resource manager
- Particle system
- Audio system using openAL as a backend
- Navmesh generator
- A collection of extra utilities and classes
